Gravity allows users to play in an magical version of mundane moments, where their movements can control the rules of physics. Combining simplified motion-capture suits, indoor position and projection mapping technology, users move their bodies to control objects in zero gravity. Working together they can change the world visually and aurally.

Toolkit: Unreal Engine, Openframework, Kinect, OSC, Socket.io, Android Studio, Syphon, Spout, TCP Syphon, TCP Spout, Motion Capture Suit, Resolume.
