VillageLIVE is an augmented reality walking tour through the streets of New York City told through the archive of Nelson Sullivan, a documentarian of the city’s queer scene in the 1980s. VillageLIVE brings past narratives back to life in the streets where prominent figures of the city’s queer history once flourished. We have chosen a selection of Nelson’s videos to set the scene and to tell a narrative that includes stories of gentrification, of the notion of public safety for the queer community, and of the revolutionary roots of NYC’s queer society, dating back to the Stonewall Riots in 1969.We have also developed this project as an AR app and 360 video web experience through a grant from A+E Networks, in partnership with NYC Media Lab.  As we continue to develop you can see a demonstration of the current state of the app here.
